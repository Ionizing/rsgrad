# Introduction

`rsgrad` is an open-source command-line tool to help [VASP](https://vasp.at) players play better with VASP.  
__`rsgrad` is written proudly in pure Rust__.

Now `rsgrad` provides several features:
1. Track the relaxation and MD (molecular dynamics) progress;
2. Calculate and visualize the DOS (density of states) and pDOS (projected DOS);
3. Plot and visualize the band structure and fat band structure;
4. Save the frames with given MD or relaxation trajectory;
5. Calculate charge density difference;
6. Analyze the vibration eigen values and eigen vectors;
7. Plot the wave function at given bands in real-space;
8. Plot the wave function at given bands in real-space then integrate it over specified plane;
9. Plot and visualize the work function;
10. Split _POSCAR_;  
    Convert between fractional coordinates and Cartesian coordinates;  
    Format _POSCAR_;
11. Generate _POTCAR_ according to _POSCAR_.

Wish you have a good time with `rsgrad` ^\_^
